- prettier can be removed completely once dprint has its own yaml plugin + better json5 support
- prettier markdown formatting was always subpar; it never played nicely with markdownlint
- prettier/prettier#15358
- prettier/prettier#5715
- prettier/prettier#11881
- dprint/dprint#736
- dprint/dprint-plugin-typescript#432
