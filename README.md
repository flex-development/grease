## Getting Started

**`grease`** is a package release workflow tool for Node and CLI environments.

Built on top of the [`standard-version`][5] library, it helps project
maintainers create releases and upload release assets via the [GitHub CLI][2].

By default, release notes are generated using the `CHANGELOG` entry for the most
recent semver tag. Maintainers also have the option of generating a blank note,
or skipping note generation entirely.

## Installation

1. Authenticate with [GitHub Package Registry][9] (GPR)

   **NPM**

   ```properties
   //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=$GITHUB_PAT_GPR
   @flex-development:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
   ```

   **Yarn 1**

   ```properties
   //registry.yarnpkg.com/:_authToken=$GITHUB_PAT_GPR
   @flex-development:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
   ```

   **Yarn 2**

   ```yml
   npmScopes:
     flex-development:
       npmAlwaysAuth: true
       npmAuthToken: '${GITHUB_PAT_GPR}'
       npmRegistryServer: 'https://npm.pkg.github.com'
   ```

   where `$GITHUB_PAT_GPR` is [GitHub Personal Access Token][10] with at least
   the `read:packages` scope.

2. Add project to `dependencies`

   ```zsh
   yarn add @flex-development/grease # or npm i @flex-development/grease
   ```

## Usage

**TODO**: Update documentation.
